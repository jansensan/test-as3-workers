test-as3-workers
================

This project has been originally built with FDT 5.6.2, following Lee Brimelow's tutorials (http://www.gotoandlearn.com/play.php?id=162, http://www.gotoandlearn.com/play.php?id=163). It presents a functional example of two way communication between threads in ActionScript 3.

It didn't seem to work at first, so I asked a question on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12167182/issue-with-basic-as3-workers-classes

It turns out that I was working with Flash player version 11.4.400.252, whereas the functional one was 11.4.402.265 and up.
