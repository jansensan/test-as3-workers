test-as3-workers
================

This project has been built with FDT5.

Currently, publishing "src/Secondary.as" to "www/assets/swf/secondary.swf" works properly, however when trying to run "src/Main.as", an error show up:

	Exception fault: TypeError: Error #1007: Instantiation attempted on a non-constructor.
		at Main/init()[/Volumes/DOCUMENTS/Tests/AS3/test-workers/src/Main.as:52]
		at Main()[/Volumes/DOCUMENTS/Tests/AS3/test-workers/src/Main.as:32]

I have followed Lee Brimelow's tutorials (http://www.gotoandlearn.com/play.php?id=162, http://www.gotoandlearn.com/play.php?id=163), but somehow this doesn't work.
